    <h1>The Manipur Crisis: A Consequence of Political
        Ambitions and Land Grabbing
    </h1>

    <p>The recent surge of violence in Manipur since May 3rd, 2023 is a matter of grave concern. This unprecedented situation has been attributed to the actions of two militant groups, Meitei-Leepun and Arambai Tenggol, as well as the state forces. The barbarous acts committed by these two militant groups, with the help of state forces and Meira Paibis, are profoundly unsettling. The Kuki-Zo community in the Meitei-dominated area of Imphal Valley has suffered brutal deaths and injuries exceeding 140, with no compassion shown to the old, women, and children. Hundreds more are severely injured and over 50,000 individuals are displaced as a result of this upheaval, which is truly heartbreaking. 
        The hill areas, on the contrary, have seen no harm or fatalities towards the Meitei. Instead, they have been advised to leave the hills for their safety, the decision was made to protect the people, similar to the actions taken in Mizoram. These displaced people are now forced to seek safety and security in nearby states and districts. The burden placed upon displaced students pursuing medical, engineering, and high school education, as well as the affected families, is immense, as they are unable to resume their studies and work respectively. Furthermore, the displaced students and workers are facing significant obstacles in returning to the valley to continue their education and employment due to the current circumstances. <p><br> 
    </p>
    <p>The situation in Manipur is truly alarming. The Meitei government's use of false narratives against the Kuki-Zo people, labeling them as illegal immigrants, narco-terrorists, and poppy cultivators, is a blatant attempt to conceal the truth from the public eye. This is clearly a ploy to divert attention away from the true drug lord operating anonymously in the valley region. It is evident that the recent surge of violence is not a spontaneous event, but rather a calculated and deliberate act. The Meitei militant groups and state forces, under the leadership of Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, must be held accountable for their involvement in such heinous acts. It is disconcerting that Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are allegedly and anonymously supporting these horrifying acts without revealing their true identities. </p><br>
    <p>The reprehensible act committed against two Kuki-Zo women, who were handed over to a violent mob by the Manipur police, resulting in their public humiliation through being paraded naked, molested, and subjected to gang rape, is a deplorable and disgraceful act that has brought great shame upon our nation. It is regrettable that the sacrifices and bravery of the Kuki-Zo men who valiantly defended their villages against the Meitei radical attack went largely unnoticed. Their commendable courage in the face of such adversity is dishearteningly unrecognized by many. </p><br>
    <p>The Meitei government's use of false narratives against the Kuki-Zo people is a clear attempt to deceive the public and obscure the truth. By unjustly labeling them as illegal immigrants, narco-terrorists, and poppy cultivators, where the government is trying to divert attention from the real culprit, an anonymous drug lord operating in the valley region. It is evident that the recent surge of violence is not an isolated incident, but rather a calculated and deliberate act. Those responsible, including the Meitei militant groups and state forces under Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, must be held accountable for these atrocious acts. It is disconcerting that Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are silently supporting these horrifying actions. </p><br>
    <p>The BJP government's actions in Manipur, particularly their pursuit of land acquisition involving the Kuki-Zo tribal lands, are deeply troubling. Where the Kuki-Zo people, constituting a mere 16.2% of the state's population, find themselves at a distinct disadvantage in political power compared to the Meitei community, which comprises a majority of 53%. This demographic imbalance translates into an imbalance of political power, with 40 out of the 60 seats in the Manipur assembly held by the Meitei population. The remaining 20 seats are reserved for various tribal communities, including the Kuki-Zo and Naga.</p><br>
